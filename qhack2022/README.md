Project Description:
1.1.1 goal:
predict the ground state energies of molecules using Coulomb matrices as input using quantum-classical Neural Networks. I hope to combine advanced feed forward neural network(FFNN) and quantum neural network(QNN) to achieve higher accuracy.

It will train over 16,242 Molecules ground state with FNN&QNN. training databset from kaggle

1.1.2 reference (those I think is important)-
[1] Predicting excited states from ground state wavefunction by supervised quantum machine learning Hiroki Kawai, Yuya O. Nakagawa (where my idea come from)
[2] Tree based machine learning framework for predicting ground state energies of molecules (where the data set from, can download from kaggle)
[3] qiskit- hybrid neural network (where I get idea how to do it)
[4] pennylane- recurrent neural network lstm (where I get idea of####)
[5] github- AdvancedNNfromScratch (where I understand step need for this project)
[6] Can One Hear the Shape of a Molecule (from its Coulomb Matrix Eigenvalues)? Joshua Schrier Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling 2020 60 (8), 3804-3811 DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00631 (where I understand little about coulomb matrix, how much thing can do with it)
